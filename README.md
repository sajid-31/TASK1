Objectives:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset to understand its characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers.
Visualize the findings using various plots to gain insights into the data.
Key Activities:

Data Loading: Load the dataset using pandas.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and any inconsistencies in the data.
Data Exploration:
Summary Statistics: Compute summary statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
Distribution Analysis: Plot histograms and box plots to understand the distribution of variables.
Correlation Analysis: Compute and visualize correlations between variables using heatmaps.
Outlier Detection: Identify and visualize outliers using scatter plots and box plots.
Data Visualization: Use matplotlib and seaborn to create various plots for visualizing the data.
Technologies Used:

Python: The programming language used for the analysis.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
seaborn: For statistical data visualization based on matplotlib.
Key Insights:

Distribution of Variables: Histograms and box plots revealed the distribution of the data, highlighting skewness and the presence of outliers.
Correlation between Variables: Heatmaps showed significant correlations between certain pairs of variables, indicating potential relationships.
Outliers: Scatter plots and box plots identified outliers, which could be important for further analysis or modeling.
