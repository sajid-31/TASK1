Objectives:

Implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training data.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
Make predictions on the test set.
Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.
Key Activities:

Data Loading: Load the dataset using pandas.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and perform any necessary data cleaning.
Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Train a simple linear regression model on the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
Predictions: Make predictions on the test set.
Visualization:
Plot the regression line.
Visualize actual vs. predicted values.
Technologies Used:

Python: The programming language used for the analysis and modeling.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations.
scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
Key Insights:

Model Performance: The model's performance is evaluated using MSE and R², which indicate how well the model fits the data.
Regression Line: The regression line provides a visual representation of the relationship between the feature and the target variable.
Actual vs. Predicted Values: The scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values helps in assessing the model's accuracy and identifying any systematic errors
